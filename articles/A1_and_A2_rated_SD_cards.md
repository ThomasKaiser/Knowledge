# Performance impact of MMC storage used on SBC

## Historical background

SD cards were initially made for pure sequential workloads (storing/reading pictures or video). The vast majority of cards was only optimized for this single use case and performed extremely poorly with random IO access patterns.

When using SD cards as main storage on SBC (single board computers) this limitation resulted in poor performance since the main storage access pattern when running Linux or Android is random IO (accessing mostly small chunks of data in a random fashion in contrary to sequentially writing/reading large chunks of data in cameras and video recorders).

SD Association's 'speed classes' only dealt with sequential IO (minimum MB/s ratings) and it was an adventure to find SD cards that also perform ok-ish or even great with random IO access patterns as it's normal with Android/Linux. See here for a historical overview trying to find good SD cards for the use case 2 1/2 years ago: [https://forum.armbian.com/topic/954-sd-card-performance/](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/954-sd-card-performance/)

The stuff we do mostly on SBC requires high *random* IO but is not that much dependent on *sequential* performance unless you stream data (the NAS use case for example). So running off storage with superior random IO performance greatly improves the time needed to boot, browse the web (browser do constant random IO in the background), install updates and so on.

## 'Application Performance Class' to the rescue

Some time ago SD Association tried to address this problem and defined also specs and 'speed classes' for random IO access patterns mainly with Android in mind: the [Application Performance Classes](https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/application/index.html) A1 and A2 were invented.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190105185249/https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/application/img/img_application.jpg)

### Application Performance Class 1 (A1)

This performance class requires at least 1500/500 read/write IOPS (IO operations per second) with a 4k blocksize (small data chunks) and at least 10 MB/s sustained sequential write performance. No special host requirements are needed, the card simply has to exceed the performance requirements on its own.

At the end of 2017 we were already able to buy some great performing A1 rated cards that are multiple times faster than what the specs require. E.g. a SanDisk Extreme A1 being two to six times faster than required by A1 specs.

### Application Performance Class 2 (A2)

A2 promises even better performance with 4000/2000 read/write IOPS minimum but there's a problem since as outlined by the SD Association A2 cards show "much higher performance than A1 performance by using functions of Command Queuing and Cache".

Cache and Command Queuing require host (driver) support since the host needs to activate those new features first. The cache feature on A2 rated cards makes use of volatile RAM on the card requiring the host to learn new commands to issue flushing the cache (involving the risk of data losses -- for details see especially chapter 4.17 in [Physical Layer Simplified Specification 6.0](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/pdf/index.php?p=Part1_Physical_Layer_Simplified_Specification_Ver6.00.jpg&f=Part1_Physical_Layer_Simplified_Specification_Ver6.00.pdf&e=EN_SS1))

### Real world 2018 A1 and A2 performance comparison

I recently acquired two A2 rated SanDisk cards and to my surprise they were both slower than my older SanDisk A1 rated cards. They barely meet A1 specs (the 1500/500 read/write IOPS) and since silly me didn't read the specs before I thought the SanDisk Extreme Plus A2 I bought first would be defective so I returned it to Amazon and bought a SanDisk Extreme Pro A2 instead.

The Extreme Pro is even slightly slower than the Extreme Plus and only now I started to understand that A2 cards can only show their performance if the host is also 'A2 compliant' needing updated MMC drivers to deal with these new cards. It seems at the time of this writing this is still missing in Linux (tested with 4.19.0-rc4).

## Benchmarking the cards

I rely on the following methodology for testing (using [sd-card-bench.sh](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench/blob/master/sd-card-bench.sh)):

* `iozone` benchmark to test through sequential and random IO at various block sizes from 1KB to 16MB
* Measuring the time until `/etc/rc.local` gets executed as a means of 'boot time performance'
* Installation of a DE (desktop environment) as representation of large software installations or upgrades (~400 packages, dealing with a lot of small files and constant `sync` calls to ensure installation on disk is intact). The task is a mixture of write and read access (10 times more write than read though)
* Removing 150 packages of the DE (again a lot of synced random write IO -- deleting something is write access at the block device layer since only filesystem metadata and structures get updated)
* Reinstalling these 150 packages again, this time the packages come from the local apt cache (still in the page cache so not even involving storage access at all since still in DRAM) so speed of Internet access and upstream servers does not interfere with storage performance

![](../media/SD-Card-speed-modes.png)

All tests happen on a NanoPi M4 with UHS/SDR104 mode enabled (for reliability reasons limiting SD host controller clock source PLL configuration in a similar way to what [Hardkernel did on ODROID-N1](https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=153&t=30247#p216250) therefore bottlenecking sequential performance to ~66MB/s). Please note that the majority of SBC does not support 1.8V signaling and are therefore limited to HS mode (see table above) limiting not only sequential transfer speeds to below 25MB/s but also affecting random IO performance (see at the end of [this overview](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/954-sd-card-performance/?do=findComment&comment=49811) where I incorrectly refer to *HS mode* as *DDR50* all the time).

All tests done with a freshly built Armbian Stretch using defaults (ext4, 600 sec commit interval).

![](../media/IMG_8122.JPG)

8 different storage types were tested. In brackets the card production date according to the card's metadata:

* Intenso 'Class 4' 4GB (02/2015)
* SanDisk 'Ultra' 8GB (06/2016)
* SanDisk Industrial 8GB (02/2018)
* SanDisk Extreme Plus (07/2015)
* SanDisk Ultra A1 32GB (09/2017)
* SanDisk Extreme A1 32GB (10/2017)
* SanDisk Extreme Pro A2 64GB (08/2018)
* FriendlyELEC's Samsung eMMC 8GB module (02/2018)

The Intenso Class 4 card is used as an equivalent for 'average SD card' SBC users pull out of an old digital camera and use now for their Linux installation.

## Results overview

The links in the title row contain [sd-card-bench](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench/blob/master/sd-card-bench.sh)'s raw output to check for details. Unfortunately I forgot to upload the logfile for the 'Average' Intenso card and have overwritten the card already in the meantime for a new set of tests:

## Obvious results

* At the time of this writing due to lacking A2 host support (drivers) at least SanDisk A2 rated cards are outperformed by A1 cards from the same company (even the cheap Ultra A1 is faster everywhere except sequential write performance)
* My two A1 rated cards are from late 2017 so maybe SanDisk adjusted A1 performance in the meantime. A test with recently acquired A1 cards would be needed
* 'Average' SD cards show horribly low random write performance (for whatever reasons especially at 16k block size -- here the slowest card 'performs' over 500 times worse compared to the eMMC module)
* DE (desktop environment) installation time correlates **only** with **random** write and not sequential write performance (compare 'Class 4' with SanDisk Ultra, compare Extreme Plus with Extreme A1 and especially Ultra A1)

## Looking at storage access patterns

`sd-card-bench` runs an `iostat 20` task in the background that monitors storage activity (1st row representing what happened since last boot and then querying the kernel counters every *n* seconds -- in our case *20*). This provides some insights as to what happens in reality. Is the OS busy reading or writing, is it a mix of both, are bottlenecks becoming obvious?

The 2nd column shows the 'tps' (transactions per second, comparable with IOPS), then average throughput numbers are shown in KB/s and then absolute amount of data since last query.

### Booting

The below is the `iostat 20` output with system on the eMMC. First entry is ~16 seconds after the kernel loaded, the subsequent entries are with a 20 sec delay in between:

    Device:            tps    kB_read/s    kB_wrtn/s    kB_read    kB_wrtn
    mmcblk1         214.00     10296.19        69.67     132409        896
    mmcblk1           2.00        67.20         0.00       1344          0
    mmcblk1           0.45         0.20         2.20          4         44
    mmcblk1           0.00         0.00         0.00          0          0

While booting with this Armbian Stretch CLI image ~130 MB are read from the storage and less than 1 MB is written. So this is mostly read storage access and based on the above numbers (comparing the synthetic benchmark results with actual boot times) there are no obvious correlations to random or sequential read performance (why boots SanDisk Extreme Plus or Ultra A1 faster than the eMMC module for example?)

### Installing a Desktop Environment

This is again the eMMC while installing the DE the first time. Packages are downloaded from upstream apt servers (so 'the Internet' is a potential bottleneck here), are then stored on 'disk' and obviously partially read again (write/read ratio in the example below is exactly 10:1)

    Device:            tps    kB_read/s    kB_wrtn/s    kB_read    kB_wrtn
    mmcblk1          95.15      3558.20      4072.60      71164      81452

    mmcblk1         170.75       101.20      5659.00       2024     113180
    mmcblk1         202.30       104.20      6125.40       2084     122508
    mmcblk1         272.20       653.40      3813.60      13068      76272

This task took 178 seconds on the eMMC but a whopping 1070 seconds when running on the 'Class 4' card:

It's pretty obvious that this 'Class 4' card is limited by its **poor random write performance**: when only writes happen the tps (transactions per second) reported are around ~26 which is (not so) surprisingly slightly below the 4k random write IOPS number the iozone benchmark reported (33 4k write IOPS). Please keep in mind that all these average SD cards get a lot slower with slightly larger data chunks. The 16k random write IOPS with this card are as low as 2 (!) which is just 200 times worse compared to any recent quality SD card and even 500 times slower than the eMMC module tested.

### Removing and reinstalling the Desktop Environment

This task did an `apt purge armbian-stretch-desktop` then measuring the time of the following `apt autoremove` deleting 150 of the installed 400 packages. This is updating apt databases and filesystem structures (file deletion means write activity below the filesystem layer!). Afterwards the time for a 2nd `apt install armbian-stretch-desktop` has been measured which will install the 150 packages again that have been deleted before.

Since this time the packages are already in the local apt cache and also still in the page cache (filesystem cache) neither stuff has to be downloaded from the Internet nor even read from disk since all the packages are still hold in RAM. That's why we only see write activity this time. First on the eMMC (deletion took 27 sec and 2nd install 65):

Again the whole procedure is bottlenecked only by the **poor random write performance** (check the tps numbers vs. KB/s)

## Conclusions

* Buying cheap A1 rated cards makes a lot of sense with typical SBC use cases since random IO performance (especially write) makes the difference between working with these things flawlessly and everything being slow as hell.
* At the time of this writing with missing driver support surprisingly A2 rated cards perform lower than less expensive A1 rated cards. Until A2 host support is ready most probably this will remain the same.

## TODO

* Buy recent A1 rated SanDisk cards and check performance again. Maybe more recent SanDisk A1 cards perform now also lower than the cards measured above that were produced in late 2017 (we've seen this with other vendors already before: e.g. Samsung EVO/EVO+ and even Samsung Pro)
