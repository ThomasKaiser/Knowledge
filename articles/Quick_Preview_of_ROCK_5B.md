Early July 2022 Radxa sent out a couple Rev. 1.3 dev samples of their long awaited ROCK 5B as part of a [Debug Party](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483) to spot HW and SW problems. In the following we have a quick look on it focusing on Linux, headless operation and bring-up challenges so if you're interested in Android, gaming or similar stuff this is not for you.

In the meantime PCB Rev. 1.4 [appeared](https://nitter.net/AllnetChina/status/1550141093567778820):

![](../media/rock5b-rev-1.4.jpg)

## Overview

The board fortunately leaves the RPi form factor behind and measures 100 x 74mm (close to but definitely *not* Pico-ITX – mounting hole positions also differ from Pico-ITX)

  * SoC: Rockchip RK3588 octa-core processor with 4 Cortex-A76 cores @ *up to* 2.4 GHz, 4 Cortex-A55 cores @ ~1.8 GHz, ARM Mali G610MC4 GPU, a 6TOPS NPU, 8K 10-bit decoder, 8K encoder
  * System Memory: 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB LPDDR4x (32GB possible but currently no 128Gb LPDDR4x modules available)
  * M.2 2280 key M socket for NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen3 x4)
  * MicroSD card socket
  * eMMC socket ([pinout compatible to ODROID and Pine64](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/hardware/emmc))
  * Three independent displays supported:
  * 2 x HDMI 2.1 out up to 8Kp60 (when 1 display is 8K the other will be 4K)
  * 1 x USB-C via DisplayPort alt. mode up to 8Kp30
  * 1 x micro HDMI input up to 4Kp60
  * 2 x MIPI CSI connectors (Radxa about to sell an 8MP camera able to stream 4K @ 90 frames/sec based on SONY's IMX415 sensor, current driver is limiting to 30 fps)
  * 1 x 2.5GbE RJ45 port (RTL8125BG) with optional PoE HAT support
  * M.2 2230 key E socket (PCIe Gen2 x1) for an optional WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 M.2 module or to be used with a cheap mechanical adapter as SATA port
  * USB: 2x USB 3.0 Type-A ports, 1x USB 3.0 Type-C port, 2x USB 2.0 ports. USB3 ports limited to SuperSpeed (5 Gbps)
  * Expansion – 40-pin GPIO header
  * Powering: USB PD compliant through USB-C which carries also display and data signals so 'display with integrated Dock' mode possible

Hardware details including schematics can be found in [Radxa's wiki](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/hardware). The dev samples got some 5V powered heatsinks with integrated fan Radxa found somewhere in a drawer but the final product will be accompanied by a different, regulated and less noisy heatsink/fan combo (small PWM header on the board side). Fortunately Radxa could be convinced to also manufacture a fanless metal enclosure acting as large heatsink to [passively dissipate the SoC's and SSD's heat out of the enclosure](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-accessory/11475/18?u=tkaiser).

## RK3588

At the heart of the board is the long awaited [Rockchip RK3588](https://www.cnx-software.com/2019/04/24/rk3588-8k-arm-cortex-a76-a55-soc-rockchip-roadmap-2020/). On the left the variant shown by Radxa, on the right what I found below the fansink on my dev sample:

![](../media/rk3588_variants.jpg)

All RK3588 announcements talk about the SoC being made in an '8nm process' which of course is BS but what the '8nm' really tell us is Rockchip probably relying on Samsung and their 8LPP process since neither TSMC nor Globalfoundries have a process name with an '8' in its name. 8LPP as an *extension* of Samsung's 10LPP process [is said to have a fin pitch of 42nm and a gate pitch of 64nm](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/1443/vlsi-2018-samsungs-8nm-8lpp-a-10nm-extension/).

The CPU cores support the following extensions: fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32 atomics fphp asimdhp cpuid asimdrdm lrcpc dcpop asimddp. The topology looks like this:

    CPU sysfs topology (clusters, cpufreq members, clockspeeds)
                    cpufreq   min    max
    CPU    cluster  policy   speed  speed   core type
     0        0        0      408    1800   Cortex-A55 / r2p0
     1        0        0      408    1800   Cortex-A55 / r2p0
     2        0        0      408    1800   Cortex-A55 / r2p0
     3        0        0      408    1800   Cortex-A55 / r2p0
     4        1        4      408    2400   Cortex-A76 / r4p0
     5        1        4      408    2400   Cortex-A76 / r4p0

     7        2        6      408    2400   Cortex-A76 / r4p0

### PVTM

So we have three different CPU clusters since `cpu4/cpu5` and `cpu6/cpu7` can be controlled independently. This is important since Rockchip uses PVTM (Process-Voltage-Temperature Monitor) on its new RK3566/RK3568/RK3588 SoCs which [is somewhat part of Silicon Lifecycle Management (SLM)](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-are-pvt-sensors.html). The PVT sensors are sensing process variability and operating environment of the SoC at least while booting and both cpufreq driver and an integrated MCU then decide about clockspeeds and supply voltages which could change over time since silicon is aging.

On my dev sample the cpufreq driver enables the 2400 MHz cpufreq OPP on both A76 clusters but for example on [Willy Tarreau's board `cpu4/cpu5` get only 2304 MHz as highest OPP and `cpu6/cpu7` 2352 MHz](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/62).

Real clockspeeds are a different thing since even if on my board the 2400 MHz OPP is enabled [the A76 cores in reality clock with just 2350 MHz](https://forum.radxa.com/t/introduce-rock-5-model-b-arm-desktop-level-sbc/8361/590?u=tkaiser). With Rockchip's BSP kernel `dmesg` output contains some PVTM info. My board:

    [    3.117399] cpu cpu0: pvtm=1528
    [    3.117491] cpu cpu0: pvtm-volt-sel=5
    [    3.124529] cpu cpu4: pvtm=1785
    [    3.128495] cpu cpu4: pvtm-volt-sel=7
    [    3.136234] cpu cpu6: pvtm=1782
    [    3.140173] cpu cpu6: pvtm-volt-sel=7

(resulting in 1830 MHz on the A55 cluster and 2350 MHz on both A76 clusters) vs. Willy's:

    [    2.606324] cpu cpu0: pvtm=1482
    [    2.606542] cpu cpu0: pvtm-volt-sel=3
    [    2.614206] cpu cpu4: pvtm=1722
    [    2.618389] cpu cpu4: pvtm-volt-sel=5
    [    2.626814] cpu cpu6: pvtm=1744
    [    2.630998] cpu cpu6: pvtm-volt-sel=6

vs. [amazingfate's board](https://gist.github.com/amazingfate/17af25d7d543d253c9d608d1d90ff2c0) which results in even lower clockspeeds on the A76 cores: [highest cpufreq OPP are 2256 MHz on `cpu4/cpu5` and 2304 MHz on `cpu6/cpu7` while both A76 clusters really clock at around 2.3GHz](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/153?u=tkaiser):

    [    5.539740] cpu cpu0: pvtm=1486
    [    5.539830] cpu cpu0: pvtm-volt-sel=4
    [    5.546847] cpu cpu4: pvtm=1701
    [    5.550813] cpu cpu4: pvtm-volt-sel=4
    [    5.558544] cpu cpu6: pvtm=1717
    [    5.562484] cpu cpu6: pvtm-volt-sel=5

Please note that PVTM also handles the GPU and NPU parts of the SoC. For more details about the basics behind these mechanisms see chapters 17 and 18 in [RK3588's Technical Reference Manual part 2](https://dl.radxa.com/rock5/hw/datasheet/Rockchip%20RK3588%20TRM%20V1.0-Part2%2020220309.pdf) (beware: that's a ~3700 pages PDF weighing 56 MB).

Next step: check whether those RK3588 where the kernel denies highest clockspeeds can be convinced by some [slight manual overvolting to allow for max performance](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/141?u=tkaiser) (resulting in slightly higher consumption and temperatures at full load of course!).

### Performance

RK3588's CPU performance is amazing and so far the highest we've seen with any somewhat affordable SBC. Numbers are already in `sbc-bench`'s [results collection](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench/blob/master/Results.md) but let's look directly at the 'most popular SBC in the world' (RPi 4B), ODROID N2+, another recent octa-core newcomer ([Khadas VIM4](https://www.cnx-software.com/2021/10/21/khadas-vim4-amlogic-a311d2-sbc/) based on Amlogic A311D2), Qualcomm QRB5165 (Snapdragon 865) and ROCK 5B:

| SBC | Clockspeed | 7-zip st* | 7-zip mt* | aes-256-cbc | memcpy | memset | kH/s |
| :-----: | :--------: | ----: | ----: | ------: | ------: | -----: | -----: |
| [RPi 4B](http://ix.io/3OBF) | 1800 | 1769 | 5790 | 36260 | 2330 | 3120 | 8.74 |
| [ODROID N2+](http://ix.io/3DtN) | 2400/2015 | 2253 | 9790 | 1366930 | 4300 | 7480 | n/a |
| [VIM4](http://ix.io/3Wvv) | 2200/1970 | 2081 | 12090 | 1253200 | 7810 | 11600 | 22.14 |
| [ROCK 5B](http://ix.io/41BH) | 2350/1830 | 3146 | 16450 | 1337540 | 10830 | 29220 | 25.31 |
| [Qualcomm QRB5165](http://ix.io/49kx) | 2840/2410/1790 | 3898 | 18860  | 1598490 | 14470 | 23910 | 25.56** |

*\* st = single-threaded, mt = multi-threaded*<br>
**\* cpuminer score would be higher if compiled with a more recent GCC version like the other boards (GCC 7.5 vs. 9/10)*

Even if currently the LPDDR4x is configured to run at only 2112MHz by [some boot BLOB](https://github.com/radxa/rkbin/blob/6d6571d21c1d9e4dda4c37fd54a6e2e847589e9a/bin/rk35/rk3588_ddr_lp4_2112MHz_lp5_2736MHz_v1.07.bin) memory performance is awesome: high bandwidth, low latency, 4 channels, very low inter-core latency since shared L3 cache for all cores. For more details see [here](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/44?u=tkaiser) and [there](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/61?u=tkaiser).

## Powering

Powering the board can be done through the USB-C port with either an [USB PD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#USB_Power_Delivery) compliant charger or with a barrel-to-USB-C adapter with a fixed voltage or with 5V via the GPIO header (expect damage/undervoltage/underpowering with anything other than USB PD if you don't know what you do). QuickCharge isn't supported. The PMU is accessible through I2C so we can ask it what has been negotiated with `sensors tcpm_source_psy_4_0022-i2c-4-22`.

With a 'dumb' 15W RPi USB-C power brick (not USB PD compliant) obviously we're ending up with 15W:

    in0:           5.00 V  (min =  +5.00 V, max =  +5.00 V)
    curr1:         3.00 A  (max =  +3.00 A)

With some 24W USB-C charger 18W get negotiated:

    in0:          12.00 V  (min = +12.00 V, max = +12.00 V)
    curr1:         1.50 A  (max =  +1.50 A)

And with an Apple '96W USB-C Power Adapter' we're at 27W:

    in0:           9.00 V  (min =  +9.00 V, max =  +9.00 V)
    curr1:         3.00 A  (max =  +3.00 A)

When [providing static 12V via an adapter to the USB-C port](https://forum.radxa.com/t/fixed-voltage-power-supply-options/10803/9?u=tkaiser) the output *wrongly* reads 5V/1.5A which is the lowest power mode defined with USB-C and reflects the state of the adapter's configuration channel (CC) pins:

    in0:           5.00 V  (min =  +5.00 V, max =  +5.00 V)
    curr1:         1.50 A  (max =  +1.50 A)

Real input voltage is constantly measured and can be accessed via sysfs ([needs to be divided by ~172.5](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/317?u=tkaiser)):

	awk '{printf ("%0.2f\n",$1/172.5); }' </sys/devices/iio_sysfs_trigger/subsystem/devices/iio\:device0/in_voltage6_raw
	11.98

Radxa uses an I2C attached Fairchild FUSB302 USB PD controller on the board and the above USB PD negotiations [are exactly what's defined in the `sink-pdos` device-tree node](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/blob/5e6d32859dfb73c1cfeefcc8074282480219caab/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3588-rock-5b.dts#L676-L679):

    <PDO_FIXED(5000, 3000, PDO_FIXED_USB_COMM)
     PDO_FIXED(9000, 3000, PDO_FIXED_USB_COMM)
     PDO_FIXED(12000, 1500, PDO_FIXED_USB_COMM)>;

Only 5V, 9V and 12V are defined (the USB PD chip should always choose the hightest voltage the charger advertises). Let's adjust the values in the following way (allowing 3A instead of 1.5A with 12V and adding 15V and 20V definitions)

    <PDO_FIXED(5000, 3000, PDO_FIXED_USB_COMM)
    PDO_FIXED(9000, 3000, PDO_FIXED_USB_COMM)
    PDO_FIXED(12000, 3000, PDO_FIXED_USB_COMM)
    PDO_FIXED(15000, 3000, PDO_FIXED_USB_COMM)
    PDO_FIXED(20000, 2250, PDO_FIXED_USB_COMM)>;

Now it looks like this with the aforementioned 24W charger able to provide full 24W since also capable of 15V:

    in0:          15.00 V  (min = +15.00 V, max = +15.00 V)
    curr1:         1.60 A  (max =  +1.60 A)

And with the Apple charger 45W got negotiated as configured:

    in0:          20.00 V  (min = +20.00 V, max = +20.00 V)
    curr1:         2.25 A  (max =  +2.25 A)

ROCK 5B's USB-C details can be accessed via sysfs:

    grep "" /sys/class/typec/port0/* 2>/dev/null
    data_role:host [device]
    orientation:normal
    port_type:[dual] source sink
    power_operation_mode:usb_power_delivery
    power_role:source [sink]
    preferred_role:sink
    supported_accessory_modes:none
    uevent:DEVTYPE=typec_port
    uevent:TYPEC_PORT=port0
    usb_power_delivery_revision:3.0
    usb_typec_revision:1.2
    vconn_source:no
    waiting_for_supplier:0

If `power_operation_mode` is not USB PD then it reflects the state of the CC pins: `3.0A` with the RPi power brick and `1.5A` with the aforementioned 'static' 12V fed by a barrel-to-USB-C adapter. Please note that these amperage numbers never represent any real consumption but are just the result of negotiated USB PD settings / CC pins.

You find some limited information about the other end of the cable below `/sys/class/typec/port0/port0-partner`, e.g. `supports_usb_power_delivery`:

  * no (barrel adapter)
  * no (15W RPi power brick)
  * yes (24W charger)
  * yes (96W charger)

Even more information about FUSB302 negotiations are available with Rockchip's BSP kernel via debugfs:

    cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/fusb302-4-0022 /sys/kernel/debug/usb/tcpm-4-0022 | sort

That way one for example can look what the connected USB PD compliant charger provides and what the driver then chose:

    [    3.272362]  PDO 0: type 0, 5000 mV, 3000 mA [DE]
    [    3.272371]  PDO 1: type 0, 9000 mV, 2660 mA []
    [    3.272379]  PDO 2: type 0, 12000 mV, 2000 mA []
    [    3.272386]  PDO 3: type 0, 15000 mV, 1600 mA []
    ...
    [    3.272426] cc=2 cc1=0 cc2=5 vbus=0 vconn=sink polarity=1

## Consumption

I'm measuring with a NetIO PowerBox 4KF in a [rather time consuming process](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench/blob/e6cfb870c7a297abf96f51b7305600c0e48d1951/sbc-bench.sh#L385-L408) that means 'at the wall' with charger included with averaged idle values over 4 minutes.

The small fan on my dev sample is responsible for ~700mW, switching network between Gigabit Ethernet and 2.5GbE makes up for another ~300mW. Adjusting PCIe powermanagement (`/sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy` – see below why that's important) from `powersave` to `default` makes up for another ~100mW.

So the board idles below 1.4W w/o any peripherals except Gigabit Ethernet. A fan adds extra juice, 2.5GbE instead of GbE as well, avoiding super powersavings settings also.

Connecting a HDMI display (`Update mode to 1920x1200p60, type: 11(if:800) for vp0 dclk: 154000000`) increases consumption by ~350mW (though screen blanked) as such 'display activity' of course also increases consumption when HDMI PHY and other SoC engines are active.

Rockchip's Dynamic Memory Interface (DMC) is accompanied by a driver that allows to (dynamically) adjust RAM timings. With the BSP kernel once the `dmc` device-tree node is enabled the `dmc_ondemand` governor is active by default clocking the DRAM with 528 MHz in idle and up to 2112 MHz 'under load' though there are various situations when the [memory clock isn't ramping up fast enough](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/423?u=tkaiser). The difference in idle between `dmc_ondemand` and `performance` is a whopping ~600mW. For details see [here](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/441?u=tkaiser) and [there](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/458?u=tkaiser).

The good news: RK3588 is made in such an advanced process that running the most demanding benchmark on this thing ([7-zip's internal benchmark](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench#7-zip)) on all cores results in ~6W extra consumption compared to idle.

Please be aware that measuring only CPU loads does not really represent the SoC's capabilities since it ignores everything else that makes up RK3588:

  * GPU (2D/3D acceleration)
  * VPU (accelerated video encoding/decoding)
  * NPU (machine learning: artificial neural networks, random forests)
  * in general the media capabilities like display and camera support, 'picture in picture' and so on (maybe only ever working in Android, [BSP Linux](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/384?u=tkaiser) but not mainline Linux)
  * I/O: RK3588 has serious I/O capabilities especially compared to toys like an RPi 4

But if we're only looking at CPU loads, throw away Radxa's fansink and let RK3588 run without any cooling at an ambient temp of 26°C it looks really great [since only slight throttling happens](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/97?u=tkaiser).

What happens if we `shutdown -h now` the board: 0W or just a few mW since the power led still lights but everything else is powered down. Compare this for example with an [RPi 4B that sucks ~1.2W from the wall after 'being powered off'](https://hackaday.com/2021/11/01/the-pi-zero-2-w-is-the-most-efficient-pi/).

## LEDs

There's a green led working as power led (lights on when power is supplied and goes off with no power) and there's a blue led called <del>`sta`, living at `/sys/class/leds/sta`, defaulting to `timer` which results in constant blinking.</del>. [This led has been renamed to 'blue:status' now and defaults to 'heartbeat' instead](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/commit/fd19d9f5c7de3c600551ed9b0b61f8da95988894).

Other options: `none rfkill-any rfkill-none kbd-scrolllock kbd-numlock kbd-capslock kbd-kanalock kbd-shiftlock kbd-altgrlock kbd-ctrllock kbd-altlock kbd-shiftllock kbd-shiftrlock kbd-ctrlllock kbd-ctrlrlock tcpm-source-psy-4-0022-online [timer] oneshot disk-activity disk-read disk-write ide-disk mtd nand-disk heartbeat backlight gpio cpu cpu0 cpu1 cpu2 cpu3 cpu4 cpu5 cpu6 cpu7 activity default-on transient flash torch panic netdev mmc0 mmc1`

There's also another sysfs entry called `/sys/class/leds/mmc1` but I had no luck finding the corresponding led on the board or such a node in the device-tree file.

Please be aware that we're talking about a developer sample so final product might change. Same applies to the heatsink which was a temporary hack by Radxa to provide us early testers with something. Final heatsink implementation of course will *not* block the M.2 2280 slot on the other PCB side! But I'm still hoping for Radxa coming up with an [elegant metal enclosure dissipating the heat passively away](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/113?u=tkaiser) so those heatsink mounting holes are not needed anyway.

## USB

The board features five USB ports: 2 x Hi-Speed USB-A receptacles (often called 'USB 2.0 ports'), 1 x USB-C and 2 x USB3-A receptacles. The latter two are limited to *USB SuperSpeed* AKA 5 Gbps.

While the USB2 ports share bandwidth since being behind an internal USB hub (`1a40:0101 Terminus Technology Inc. Hub`) the USB3 ports are on their own buses.

I'm not able to test USB-C capabilities since port used for powering and me lacking an USB-C/Thunderbolt dock or an appropriate display. But schematics tell that USB-C supports USB3 OTG and DisplayPort with the following lane combinations: DP x4, USB3 x4 and DP x2 + USB3 x2.

So let's focus on the two USB3 Type-A sockets (maybe the most crappy connector ever invented due to the extra tiny contacts for the SuperSpeed data lines). To spot any internal bottlenecks my test is to connect an [UAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Attached_SCSI) capable disk enclosure with an SSD inside to each USB3-A port, setup a RAID0 and see whether we're exceeding 400 MB/s or not (~400 MB/s sequential disk transfers are the maximum you get over a single 5 Gbps USB3 connection, with RK3588's BSP kernel it's ~420 MB/s)

Creating the RAID0 failed due to the usual reasons: missing parameters like [coherent_pool=2M](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/4811-uas-mainline-kernel-coherent-pool-memory-size/) and powering problems of one of the USB3 enclosures ([details](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/87?u=tkaiser)).

In this stupid SBC world almost everyone will now yell 'Disable UAS!' but it was simply missing parameters and underpowering so once that was resolved testing with `iozone -e -I -a -s 1000M -r 1024k -r 16384k -i 0 -i 1` showed these numbers:

         kB  reclen    write  rewrite    read    reread
    1024000    1024   258830   270261   341979   344249
    1024000   16384   270022   271088   667757   679947

270 MB/s write performance is crap so let's look at the (missing) tunables. After adding this to `/etc/rc.local` (to survive reboots)

    for cpufreqpolicy in 0 4 6 ; do
        echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy${cpufreqpolicy}/ondemand/io_is_busy
        echo 25 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy${cpufreqpolicy}/ondemand/up_threshold
        echo 10 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy${cpufreqpolicy}/ondemand/sampling_down_factor
        echo 200000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy${cpufreqpolicy}/ondemand/sampling_rate
    done

...even on the little A55 cores we're seeing this since now cpufreq driver ramps up clockspeeds also with storage accesses:

         kB  reclen    write  rewrite    read    reread
    1024000    1024   524857   526483   458726   459194
    1024000   16384   780470   774856   733638   734297

This is fine since close to 800 MB/s means there's no bottleneck and both USB3 type-A receptacles show full bandwidth even when accessed concurrently.

Test with a single EVO750 in an ASM1153 enclosure results in these numbers:

         kB  reclen    write  rewrite    read    reread
    1024000    1024   376952   377352   355393   355788
    1024000   16384   425026   424372   415324   415795

## Storage

The board supports various types of storage: MMC storage (SD card and eMMC), native SATA via the M.2 key E slot with a cheap mechanical adapter and a DT overlay, USB storage, NVMe via the M.2 slot(s) and since both M.2 slots carry PCIe signals any other storage type for which a PCIe controller exists (yes, you could also connect for example Enterprise SAS drives via a M.2 to PCIe adapter and some SAS HBA if you don't mind using a storage controller wasting many times more energy than the 'host')

### eMMC

Radxa will provide eMMC modules 16GB, 32GB, 64GB and 128GB in size.

They sent a 64GB FORESEE eMMC module with the board which shows high random I/O performance and 145/270 MB/s sequential write/read speeds:

`iozone -e -I -a -s 100M -r 4k -r 16k -r 512k -r 1024k -r 16384k -i 0 -i 1 -i 2`

Numbers are pretty fine if we compare with the more expensive ['orange' Samsung eMMC modules Hardkernel showcased when sending out dev samples of their canceled ODROID-N1](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/6496-odroid-n1-not-a-review-yet/?do=findComment&comment=49404):

A 16GB eMMC module Radxa sent with a RockPi 4 dev sample years ago is still lying around and is obviously bottlenecking since maxing out at 82/255 MB/s sequential write/read:

And another 16GB FORESEE module Pine64 sent some time ago most probably with a RockPro64 dev sample just to illustrate mechanical compatibility with Pine64 and ODROID eMMC modules (since performance of this cheap eMMC module clearly sucks):

BTW: Querying info (e.g. manufacturer ID or production date) from such MMC devices is done by parsing sysfs (searching for `find /sys -name oemid`) or `udevadm info -a -n /dev/mmcblkN`.

### SD card

The SD card interface is SDXC compliant and as such supports capacities up to 2 TB (though such cards do not exist today or simply are fakes reporting wrong capacity). SD card has lower boot priority than eMMC if both are present and both contain a working boot loader (at least as long as we're talking about u-boot TPL/SPL, once an OS image relies on Rockchip's miniloader [it gets complicated](http://opensource.rock-chips.com/wiki_Boot_option#Package_the_idbloader.img_from_U-Boot.C2.A0TPL.2FSPL.28which_is_fully_open_source.29:)).

[According to device-tree settings](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/blob/78d311de923fc0644e4700f30813120835fec9cf/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3588-rock-5b.dts#L426-L440) the SD card interface should be capable of SDR104 mode (switching from 3.3V to 1.8V with up to 104 MB/s sequential transfer speeds). Let's have a look with the usual `iozone` call and two cards:

We're nowhere near 104 MB/s since the interface is lower clocked for some safety headroom and therefore limited to below 70 MB/s sequential transfers which is [an established safety mechanism in the industry](https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=153&t=30247#p216250).

Though random I/O benefits from SDR104 mode but mostly depends on the SD card you buy ([more insights on SD card performance and other numbers to compare](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/Knowledge/blob/master/articles/A1_and_A2_rated_SD_cards.md)).

Update due to Radxa having reacted to this review now [clocking the SD card higher](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/commit/dc46fcef4ac28b044f88320318c28b0a7132fa53):

    SanDisk Extreme 32GB A1 from 2017                   random    random

We're now at close to 90MB/s (most probably my SD card being the bottleneck here) but looking at maximum sequential transfer speeds with SD cards is stupid anyway since random I/O is what matters if an OS runs off of such card. And here at least with larger block sizes we're seeing some improvements. Let's hope that users of crappy SD cards won't report data corruption now :)

### SPI NOR flash

SPI NOR flash is some little amount of rather slow but cheap flash storage meant to hold a bootloader and some config (you all know this from PCs with their UEFI and BIOS in the past). In Oct 2022 with production boards the SPI flash should be prepopulated with a boot loader supporting [SD card, eMMC and NVMe](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/install) (maybe USB, SATA and even network later).

According to schematics a XT25F128B from XTX Technology (16MB SPI NOR flash) should be on the board but at least on PCB revisions 1.3 and 1.4 it's a Macronix chip. <del>It's not accessible from Linux right now since the respective device-tree node for the SFC (Rockchip Serial Flash Controller) hasn't been added yet.</del> [This commit](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/commit/cb09ad15af757db12fc64c2477a6572aaa4b8095) enabled it as `mtd` device in Linux/Android so the contents can be overwritten from the running OS.

It is also possible to flash a bootloader externally via Maskrom mode. Quick check whether the SPI storage is accessible from a host computer (MacBook running macOS) using [Rockchip flashing tools](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/install/rockchip-flash-tools) with ROCK 5B connected to the USB-C (OTG) port:

### USB

The two USB2 Hi-Speed receptacles share bandwidth since an internal hub is in between so the best you could expect is around 34/37 MB/s write/read sequential transfer speeds with UAS (RK's BSP kernel supports UAS with USB2):

    Samsung EVO750 in ASM1153 enclosure                 random    random
        kB  reclen    write  rewrite    read    reread    read     write
    102400       4    10523    10559    10565    10569     8007    10563
    102400      16    21345    21443    25068    25079    21281    21427
    102400     512    34127    34082    34798    34991    36101    34139
    102400    1024    34418    34348    37550    37593    37266    34392
    102400   16384    34569    34602    37812    37846    37844    34561

As can be seen while sequential transfer speeds suck random I/O is great (UAS rulez).

The USB3 SuperSpeed Type-A receptacles are on their own buses and show their full potential even with concurrent accesses (see [above](#usb)).

In a 4 lane configuration (no DisplayPort alt mode at the same time) the USB-C port should support *SuperSpeed 10Gps* but unfortunately not able to test since lacking an USB-C/Thunderbolt Dock.

### NVMe

NVMe I can't test currently since having only crappy M.2 SSDs lying around that will be the bottleneck. But since Radxa reports +2700 MB/s sequential read speeds and we know the little sibling RK3568 can saturate PCIe Gen3 x2 while lacking the four big A76 cores I'm pretty confident that we're seeing full Gen3 x4 NVMe performance with this device. The (more demanding) tests with 10GbE network cards [already hint at this](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/289?u=tkaiser).

### SATA

Testing SATA also not possible since lacking the inexpensive mechanical adapter that goes into the M.2 key E slot to [turn PCIe into native SATA via a device-tree overlay](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/guide/sata):

![ROCK 5B SATA adapter](../media/rock_5b_m2_sata.jpeg)

This works since RK3588 features three Combo PIPE PHYs that are [pinmuxed and provide either SATA, PCIe Gen2 or USB3](https://www.cnx-software.com/2021/12/16/rockchip-rk3588-datasheet-sbc-coming-soon/). While I can't provide performance numbers we know from the little sibling RK3568 that SATA performance is as expected for SATA 6 Gbps. And there are [further possibilities with this little M.2 slot](https://forum.radxa.com/t/radxa-rock5-rk3588-sbc-pcie-lanes-clarification/9580/18?u=tkaiser).

With RK3568 it's also confirmed SATA port multipliers like JMB575 do work (though not clear yet why FIS-based switching (FBS) won't be enabled by default and we're stuck at CBS (Command-based Switching). I asked Rockchip, posted [answer in Odroid forum](https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?p=352955#p352955) and user @zupet confirmed that FBS works.

So we know this will work with RK3588 / ROCK 5B as well and the little M.2 adapter combined with a JMB575 allows for up to five SATA devices to be connected of course sharing bandwidth/latency of the single 6Gbps SATA lane (SATA port multipliers allow for up to 15 devices per port but those larger PMs usually can be found in the backplanes of 'cold storage' servers).

![JMB575 SATA port multiplier](../media/rock5b-JMB575.png)

As for performance with a SATA PM FIS-based switching is a game changer even with spinning rust. @zupet tested with RK3568 and five WD 12TB HDDs in a RAIDz configuration. Results in MB/s:

|  | CBS| FBS |
| -----: | -----: | ----: |
| write | 76 | 201 |
| read | 120 | 189 |
| scrub | 163 | 264 |
| resilver | 130 | 397 |

Especially the last number (3 times faster at resilvering) is essential since once a RAIDz is degraded it's important to establish redundancy again as fast as possible!

## Networking

ROCK 5B's network interface is 2.5GbE capable due to an PCIe attached RealTek RTL8125BG NIC (using one of the PCIe Gen2 lanes: `Speed 5GT/s (ok), Width x1`). Asking `ethtool enP4p65s0`:

Driver and (missing) firmware info using `ethtool -i enP4p65s0`:

The MAC address is `00:e1:4c:68:00:1c` which is an unknown [OUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizationally_unique_identifier) according to all lookup services but since RealTek registered [`00:e0:4c`](https://macaddress.io/mac-address-lookup/3jRG91Vb56) most probably it's another RealTek range recently added.

Network performance in TX direction was fine since exceeding 2.32 Gbit/sec but in RX direction it sucked (~500 Mbit/sec max). After [adjusting PCIe powermanagement](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/86?u=tkaiser) also +2.32 GBit/sec but there's some room for improvements since Rockchip's BSP kernel doesn't care at all about network tunables. This is stuff for further investigation/tuning.

## PCIe

RK3588 [features five PCIe 3.0 controllers and exposes seven PCIe lanes max](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/Knowledge/blob/master/articles/PCIe_and_ARMv8_SoCs.md): four times Gen3 and three times Gen2, the latter all behind Combo PIPE PHYs and pinmuxed with either SATA or USB3.

![](../media/rk3588-pci3-controllers.png)

The Gen3 implementation supports the following modes (often called 'bifurcation'): 1 x x4 (default 'NVMe mode'), 4 x x1, 2 x x2 and 1 x x2 + 2 x x1. On ROCK 5B two clocks are routed to the M.2 key M slot as such with a device-tree overlay [x4 can be turned into 2 x x2 without an additional PCIe switch](https://forum.radxa.com/t/guide-use-intel-optane-memory-h10-with-rock5b-pcie-splitting/11598?u=tkaiser).

Of the three Gen2 lanes Radxa used one to attach the RTL8125BG NIC, another is routed to the key E M.2 slot which can be turned into SATA via a DT overlay. The other possible lane is USB3 instead.

In the meantime Willy Tarreau made some tests with a quad 10GbE NIC using an M.2 PCIe adapter [and the board performed excellent even with the BSP kernel](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/289?u=tkaiser).

## Audio codec

A 32-pin [ES8316](http://everest-semi.com/pdf/ES8316%20PB.pdf) "high performance and low power multi-bit delta-sigma audio ADC and DAC" is connected via I2S to the SoC (check page 21 of schematics for more info).

## RTC

There's a small I2C accessible HYM8563 RTC chip (though labeled BM8563) on the board. Close to it is a small battery header. According to schematics it's routed to both RK3588 and the Wi-Fi slot.

Quick check for `/dev/rtc0` succeeded: `hwclock -r -f /dev/rtc0 -> 2022-07-10 17:58:05.660866+02:00`.

All that's missing is the usual battery featuring the usual connector:

## Software

Only rudimentary mainline Linux support so far since RK3588 upstreaming by [Collabora](https://www.collabora.com) and Rockchip [started only few months ago](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20220422170920.401914-1-sebastian.reichel@collabora.com/) but will take years. As such now every RK3588 device runs with Rockchip's BSP kernel that shows currently version number 5.10.66 or higher with Armbian since they're doing version string cosmetics. This is not 5.10 LTS from kernel.org but [some forward ported mess from 2.6.32 on](https://forum.radxa.com/t/the-radxa-bsp-kernel-patches-from-5-10-67-to-5-10-123/11647/9?u=tkaiser). ROCK 5B repos are:

  * [https://github.com/radxa/kernel/tree/stable-5.10-rock5](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/tree/stable-5.10-rock5)
  * [https://github.com/radxa/u-boot/tree/stable-5.10-rock5](https://github.com/radxa/u-boot/tree/stable-5.10-rock5)

Rockchip's official RK3588 SDKs can be found here: [https://gitlab.com/rk3588_linux](https://gitlab.com/rk3588_linux)

Wrt mainline Linux/u-boot and *BSD the good news is that a lot of the upstreaming work that went into RK356x can directly be used with RK3588 as well. For example the drivers for [Naneng Micro's USB3.0/PCIE2/SATA3 Combo PHY](http://www.nanengmicro.com/en/combo-phy/) that are submitted [upstream by Rockchip themselves and successfully tested on RK3566 and RK3568 boards](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220208091326.12495-1-yifeng.zhao@rock-chips.com/T/#t) will work with RK3588 as well.

## Board bring-up

It seems some of the early adopters were told to send ROCK 5B feedback via some hidden [Discord crap](https://stallman.org/discord.html) lacking any log. That's almost too stupid to be true but let's give up on the whole process and the board.

As if the Snowden revelations never happened and we could trust US tech companies and as if community fragmentation would be a great thing. And if there's no public log available then everything that happens in such a Discord channel is lost anyway...

Also the lack of any timely/reasonable feedback from Radxa simply sucks.

## Suggestions to Radxa

  * <del>set `/sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy` to `default` instead of `powersave` (w/o network RX performance is ruined)</del> ([fixed](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/commit/60071e3a4dee8a6900418fc8ed8386adf08c1ec8))
  * <del>append `coherent_pool=2M` to `extlinux.conf` (w/o most probably ‘UAS hassles’)</del> ([fixed](https://github.com/radxa/debos-radxa/commit/4ae45b073a4aa8314228fdb65d82a1b6458e9943))
  * [configure `ondemand` cpufreq governor with `io_is_busy` and friends](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/commit/55f540ce97a3d19330abea8a0afc0052ab2644ef#commitcomment-79484235) (w/o storage performance sucks)
  * Adjust DT for more USB PD negotiations (more amperage, also 15V and 20V) now that 'general problem' with USB-C PD chargers [is nailed down to a software problem](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/296?u=tkaiser).
  * Write some service that checks at booting whether there's a `/dev/nvme` device and if so check via `lspci -vv` whether there's a mismatch between SSD's advertised capabilities and negotiated ones (except the SSD being capable of Gen4 speeds ofc). Notify user if that happened so user is aware of problems with failed PCIe link training probably caused by dusty/dirty contacts in the M.2 slot
  * End of August 2022 I discovered [memory latency with recent 5.10 BSP kernel being way worse than before](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/422?u=tkaiser) due to [this commit](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/commit/4ce9a743b253c0c344686085213de1c4059b9d59). Looks like it needs an `echo performance >/sys/class/devfreq/dmc/governor` to restore memory performance in a similar way how [I did it with RK3399 long time ago](https://github.com/armbian/build/blob/fdf73a025ba56124523baefaf705792b74170fb8/packages/bsp/common/usr/lib/armbian/armbian-hardware-optimization#L241-L244). Few weeks later I tested/discovered a better tweak: `upthreshold=20` [retains (almost) full performance while still allowing for nice low idle consumption](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/472?u=tkaiser).

## Important insights and suggested optimisations

The following applies to all RK3588/RK3588S devices and not just Rock 5B:

  * Rockchip's 5.10.66 BSP kernel is **not** 5.10 LTS from kernel.org but forward ported from some 2.6 kernel since ages. Unless somebody rebases the RK code base on top of an upstream 5.10.66 LTS nobody knows how far away this kernel is from LTS. Until today nobody did this and version string cosmetics like it's always done by Armbian doesn't bring this kernel closer to 5.10 LTS ([all details](https://forum.radxa.com/t/the-radxa-bsp-kernel-patches-from-5-10-67-to-5-10-123/11647/9?u=tkaiser)).
  * RK35xx SoCs support SATA port multipliers but with kernel defaults this ends up with [significantly slower CBS (Command-based Switching) instead of FIS-based switching (FBS)](https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?p=352955#p352955).
  * with RK's BSP kernel ASPM (PCIe's Active State Power Management) defaults to `powersave` which results in ruined performance with certain PCIe devices. Setting `/sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy` to `default` or deleting `CONFIG_PCIEASPM_POWERSAVE=y` from kernel config fixes this at the cost of ~100mW higher idle consumption.
  * Without setting `coherent_pool=2M` in `extlinux.conf` (or any boot script that defines kernel cmdline) or patching coherent pool size in the kernel sources USB storage problems that always will be stupidly blamed as 'USB Attached SCSI (UAS) problems' will likely occur ([details](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/89?u=tkaiser)).
  * When an OS image defaults to `ondemand` cpufreq governor to lower idle consumption I/O performance is severely harmed. With `schedutil` it's not significantly better. It needs [`ondemand` + `io_is_busy` and friends](https://github.com/radxa/kernel/commit/55f540ce97a3d19330abea8a0afc0052ab2644ef#commitcomment-79484235).
  * With RK's defaults USB PD negotiations on devices with FUSB302 controller are limited to 27W max (only 5V@3A, 9V@3A and 12V@1.5A defined). For this to change adjusting the `sink-pdos` device-tree node is necessary.
  * The reported cpufreq clockspeeds are chosen dynamically and do not represent real clockspeeds that vary for a number of reasons. For real clockspeeds use for example [sbc-bench](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench) and check the [PVTM explanation above](#pvtm) for what's going on.
  * The A55 cores are usually clocked with 1800 MHz or slightly above (again PVTM) which should provide enough juice for a lot of tasks. Though interrupts and services that all end up on `cpu0` (a little A55 core) caused by default scheduler behaviour might be bottlenecked by this single CPU core maxing out at 100%. If something like this is observed (`atop` is a great tool for this) it needs IRQ/SMP affinity settings pinning specific interrupts or tasks to specific CPU cores.
  * Once Rockchip's Dynamic Memory Interface (DMC) is active (by enabling the `dmc`/`dfi` device-tree nodes) idle consumption drops by 500-600mW but performance is harmed as well with all tasks that depend on memory performance. Rockchip's BSP kernel defaults (`dmc_ondemand` memory governor with `upthreshold=40`) fail to ramp up DRAM clock as fast as needed. But [decreasing from `40` to `20` seems already to be sufficient](https://forum.radxa.com/t/rock-5b-debug-party-invitation/10483/472?u=tkaiser).

So all that's needed to benefit from 500-600mW lower idle consumption while maintaining almost full performance is choosing `dmc_ondemand` memory governor plus either `echo "devices/platform/dmc/devfreq/dmc/upthreshold = 20" >/etc/sysfs.d/dmc_upthreshold.conf` or `echo 20 >/sys/devices/platform/dmc/devfreq/dmc/upthreshold` somewhere in a start script or service.

Looking at idle consumption and 7-zip scores the results are obvious:

| dmc governor | total 7-ZIP MIPS | compression | decompression | idle consumption |
| :----- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| [upthreshold 40](http://ix.io/494Y) | 14727 | 12758 | 16697 | 1280mW |
| [upthreshold 20](http://ix.io/4bhf) | 16365 | 15126 | 17604 | 1280mW |
| [performance](http://ix.io/41BH) | 16506 | 15369 | 17643 | 1920mW |

Same with Geekbench:
